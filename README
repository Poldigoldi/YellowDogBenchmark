BENCHMARK APP

This application runs a benchmark test on CentOS VMs, which are indented to represent cloud instances.
The VMs launch agents upon startup to communicate with the YellowDog platform.
As of now the configuration only works over a local network.
The benchmark is run via vray-benchmarking:
https://www.chaosgroup.com/vray/benchmark

Instructions:

Import and Create the VMs:

1. Download and install VirtualBox
2. Download the CentOS_VM.ova file from here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWUMiY6x0ZODrWDR1VnpZj_IAa6_jexF/view?usp=sharing
3. Open VirtualBox and go to File >> Import Appliance...
4. Select CentOS_VM.ova
5. Click 'Import'
Once finished you can start the VM.
6. Configure the network as explained here:
https://www.tecmint.com/network-between-guest-vm-and-host-virtualbox/
7. Update the schema url to use your network IP in /opt/agent/application.yaml


You can now run the benchmark app by following these steps:

	1. Start Platform
		a. Navigate to platform folder and execute "docker-compose up"
	2. Start VMs
		a. Headlessly start the VM
		    The agent service should automatically start but if it doesn't, you can manually run the agent.jar file
		    which is located in /opt/agent/
		b. Wait for platform to register the worker
	3. Run Benchmark app
		a. Ensure the numOfAgents in benchmark.java class matches the number of running VMs.
		b. Run application
	4. Once finished, the report.txt can be found in the benchmark app root folder.


If you want to add more VMs with agents you need to do the following:

	1. Import VM as explained above.
	2. Ensure to change the static IP address for the VM as explained in
	https://www.tecmint.com/network-between-guest-vm-and-host-virtualbox/
	3. SSH into VM root@NEW_IP_ADDRESS with password "yellowdog"
	4. Execute "sudo vi /opt/agent/application.yaml"
	5. Increment instance-type, save and exit.
	6. Reboot
    7. Match numOfAgents in benchmark.java






ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:


Setup of VM:

To setup the virtual machine CentOS was chosen. Reason for this is that vray-benchmark suggests using this OS.
The minimal ISO was downloaded as desktop usage is not necessary. The agent folder was added to the VM via the
ssh scp command and stored under /opt/
The application.yaml needed the following changes to work on the VM:
    - A tasktype called "benchmark" was added
    - A runcommand file called "benchmark.sh" was added with the following content
        eval /opt/vray-benchmark-4.10.06 --mode vray --quiet -o /opt/agent/workers/1/bm_output.json
    - As of now the first worker path is hard coded (however the benchmarking system should only ever run one worker)
    - Changed the schema-default-url to http://192.168.99.1 (or whatever your local network IP address is)
