This application runs a benchmark test on CentOS VMs, which are indented to represent cloud instances.
The VMs launch agents upon startup to communicate with the YellowDog platform.
As of now the configuration only works over a local network.

1. Download and install VirtualBox
2. Open VirtualBox and go to File >> Import Appliance...
3. Select CentOS_VM.ova
4. Click 'Import'
Once finished you can start the VM.
5. Configure the network as explained here:

You can now run the benchmark app by following these steps:

	1. Start Platform
		a. Navigate to platform folder and execute "docker-compose up"
	2. Start VMs
		a. Headlessly start the VM
		b. Wait for platform to register the worker
	3. Run Benchmark app
		a. Ensure the numOfAgents in benchmark.java class matches the number of running VMs.
		b. Run application
	4. Once finished, the report.txt can be found in the benchmark app root folder.


If you want to add more VMs with agents you need to do the following:

	1. Import VM as explained above.
	2. Ensure to change the static IP address for the VM as explained in
