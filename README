BENCHMARK APP

This application runs a benchmark test on CentOS VMs, which are indented to represent cloud instances.
The VMs launch agents upon startup to communicate with the YellowDog platform.
As of now the configuration only works over a local network.

Instructions:

	1. Start Platform
		a. Navigate to platform folder and execute "docker-compose up"
	2. Start VMs
		a. Headlessly start both VMs
		b. Wait for platform to register the workers
	3. Run Benchmark app
		a. Ensure the numOfAgents in benchmark.java class matches the number of running VMs.
		b. Run application
	4. Once finished, the report.txt can be found in the benchmark app root folder.


If you want to add more VMs with agents you need to do the following:

	1. Clone VM
	2. Set up new static IP address for VM
	3. SSH into VM root@NEW_IP_ADDRESS with password "yellowdog"
	4. Execute "sudo vi /opt/agent/application.yaml"
	5. Increment instance type, save and exit.
	6. Reboot
    7. Match numOfAgents in benchmark.java
